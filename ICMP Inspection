Enable ICMP Inspection

Step 1: Create a Policy Map for ICMP Inspection

class-map ICMP_TRAFFIC
 match default-inspection-traffic


Step 2: Apply the Inspection to the Global Policy

policy-map global_policy
 class ICMP_TRAFFIC
  inspect icmp

Step 3: Apply the Policy Map to the Service Policy

service-policy global_policy global


Now, ICMP replies will be allowed, and network diagnostics (like ping and traceroute) will work correctly.
