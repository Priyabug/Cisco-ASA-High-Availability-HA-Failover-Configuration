## Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs)


access-list OUTSIDE_TO_DMZ extended permit tcp any host 192.168.2.10 eq 80  
access-list OUTSIDE_TO_DMZ extended permit tcp any host 192.168.2.10 eq 443  
access-group OUTSIDE_TO_DMZ in interface outside  



## Deny All Unwanted Traffic from Outside


access-list OUTSIDE_TO_DMZ extended deny ip any any  
access-group OUTSIDE_TO_DMZ in interface outside  

This ensures that only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted.
